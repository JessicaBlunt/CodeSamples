# CodeSamples

## Purpose
This repository is designed to provide viewers with an idea of my programming ability. Not all code is functional (partial projects are posted when the project involved many files or contributors); however, it demonstrates my familiarity with Java, Python, and C++, along with my coding style in each language. 

## Python
### TurbulenceAnalysis
I developed this code during my time as a reseach assistant at the University of Hamburg (Germany) with a group developing a Python package for turbulance analysis of wind tunnel experiments. I was not able to include the entire project, which was started long before I joined the team, but isolated various segments which I wrote or significantly altered. 

## C++
### EclipseR
This program was the result of my semester-long project for a Data Structures class. It reads data about eclipses (both past and forecast), organizes the data, and displays it according to user input. Once data is loaded into the program, more data files can be processed to either add or remove eclipses from storage. Error messages are displayed if duplicate or misformatted events are loaded, but the program continues to function in either case. 
Because this was a Data Structures project, most of the code was dedicated to defining structures including AVL trees, linked lists, and hash tables. These files can be found under Cpp/BackgroundFiles if desired.

## Java
